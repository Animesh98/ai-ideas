# AI Personal Assistant Platform

## Project Overview

A comprehensive AI-powered personal assistant web application that acts as a unified life management system. The platform features specialized AI agents that work interdependently to optimize different aspects of a user's life including fitness, nutrition, career development, hobbies, and personal growth.

## Vision Statement

Create an intelligent, adaptive personal assistant that learns from user interactions and provides contextual, actionable guidance across multiple life domains while maintaining seamless integration between different specialized agents.

## Core Features

- **Coordination Agent**: Inter-agent communication and unified planning

### Intelligent Onboarding
- Comprehensive user profiling questionnaire
- Body composition and fitness assessment
- Lifestyle and schedule analysis
- Goal prioritization and timeline establishment
- Personalized agent recommendation system

### Adaptive Planning System
- Hierarchical goal structure (Long-term → Short-term → Daily → Hourly)
- Dynamic schedule optimization
- Calendar integration and conflict resolution  
- Context-aware suggestions and reminders
- Progress-based plan adjustments

### Advanced Context Management
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for knowledge retention
- Conversation summarization and history tracking
- Cross-agent context sharing
- User preference learning and adaptation

### Progress Tracking & Analytics
