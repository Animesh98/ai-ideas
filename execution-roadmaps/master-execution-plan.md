## üß† Mental Frameworks for Success

### The Solo Founder Mindset
1. **Ruthless Prioritization**: Say no to everything except the one thing that moves the needle
2. **Customer Obsession**: Talk to users daily, build for them not for you
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Ship fast, learn fast, fix fast
4. **Sustainable Pace**: Marathon not sprint, avoid burnout
5. **Systems Thinking**: Build processes that work without you

### Decision Making Framework
**For Any Major Decision, Ask:**
1. Does this move me closer to $10K MRR?
2. Can I validate this in 2 weeks or less?
3. Is this the highest leverage activity right now?
4. Would I regret not trying this in 5 years?
5. Do I have the resources to execute properly?

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risk**: Start simple, complexity later
- **Market Risk**: Validate early and often
- **Financial Risk**: Track burn rate weekly
- **Personal Risk**: Maintain savings buffer, health insurance
- **Competitive Risk**: Move fast, build defensible moats

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Traps
- **Over-engineering**: Build MVP first, scale later
- **Perfectionism**: Ship 80% solution, iterate based on feedback
- **Feature Creep**: Focus on core value proposition
- **Technology Obsession**: Choose boring tech that works

### Business Traps
- **No Customer Discovery**: Building in a vacuum
- **Pricing Too Low**: Undervaluing your solution
- **Poor Market Timing**: Not understanding adoption cycles

### Personal Traps
