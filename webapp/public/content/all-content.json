Maybe we can use this as a multi-purpose assistant which can interact among themselves and plan out everything in my life.\n\n> Built-in macros tracking and provide insights and suggestions.\n\n> Can be hooked up with your calendar and this tool can suggest activities and times where to fit in them etc. Maybe we can make all the assistants(for different instances, we have to have some interdependebility), so that it actually behaves like perfect assistant. But for the starters, let's stick with fitness(workout/meals etc), hobbies, career(entrepeneaurship) specific agents. \n\n> Based on how you interact with the system, the AI assistant can adapt to you, and can give suggestions.\n\n> The UI/UX should be made with modern components using shadcn/ui and scss and the frontend should be absolutely professional and be made using react/typescript etc modern architectures.\n\n> For backend, pick whatever is best and free for a personal project. I guess django? Maybe or fastAPI, I have not much idea of it.\n\n> For database, pick whatever is best for these kind of tasks, I want to use free/opensource options here, but whatever is best for this task. I don't want industry grade paid options, but pick whatever is both scalable and best.\n\n> For CDN, hosting etc I have my own linux server. Maybe we can use that to host? I am not sure tho. Maybe I can spend a few rupees later on to host it. Initially, I want to use my own server and then later on I can scale it up if needed.\n\n> We can ask the user once they signup with a proper questionaire and form which takes in user's personal information like body profile, eating habits, learning ideas, health goals, reading goals, entrepenaurship goals etc. then analyze and suggest assistants for the cause. Each assistant should be interdepending and responsible for that aspect of user.\n\n> It should also ask the user about their current daily schedule(ofc in a smart manner), and what they want to improve on etc. And also should provide you suggestions in your steps while setting up as well.\n\n> Smartly maintain the context by summarizing and using RAG etc when needed.\n\n> Progress tracking by each assistant will also be different for each. It should track users process by various tools, like checklist, workout logs etc etc. Basically first they should tell what the user have to do in long term, short term, daily and hourly etc. Make it proper hieerarchical like how a software development sprint is being taken care of. Use different terminology for it, using sprint is too coorporate like.\n",
