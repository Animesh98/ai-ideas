# HyprAI - AI-Native Window Manager & System Controller

## 🎯 Vision Statement
A Hyprland fork that integrates local AI models directly into the window manager, enabling natural language system control and creating the first truly AI-native desktop experience for power users and developers.

## 🚀 The Paradigm Shift
Moving beyond traditional GUI interactions to conversational computing - where your desktop environment understands intent, context, and can execute complex workflows through natural language.

## 💡 Core Capabilities

### Phase 1 - Foundation (2-3 months)
- **Local LLM Integration**: Embed Llama-3.1-8B or Phi-3 directly in the compositor
- **Basic Commands**: Window management, application launching, workspace switching
- **Context Awareness**: Track active windows, running processes, system state
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally, no cloud dependencies

### Phase 2 - Intelligent Automation (4-6 months)
- **Workflow Learning**: Observe and automate repetitive patterns
- **Smart Suggestions**: Proactive recommendations based on usage patterns
- **System Optimization**: Auto-adjust performance settings based on workload
- **Advanced Scripting**: Generate and execute complex shell scripts on demand

### Phase 3 - Ecosystem Integration (8-12 months)
- **Application Plugins**: Deep integration with development tools
- **Cross-Platform Bridge**: Control remote systems, Docker containers, VMs
- **Voice Interface**: Whisper integration for hands-free operation
- **Visual Understanding**: Process screenshots for better context

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2. System Integration
- **IPC Bridge**: Extend Hyprland's socket protocol for AI commands
- **Process Monitor**: Real-time system state tracking
- **File System Watcher**: Monitor project directories, config changes
- **Resource Manager**: GPU/CPU allocation for AI inference

#### 3. Command Processing Pipeline
```
Natural Language → Intent Parser → Context Enricher → Action Planner → Executor → Feedback
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Backend (C++)
- **Fork Hyprland**: Start with stable base, add AI layer
- **GGML Integration**: Use llama.cpp for efficient local inference
- **Memory Management**: Smart caching for model weights
- **Thread Safety**: Separate AI inference thread from compositor

#### AI Model Selection
- **Primary**: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (good balance of capability/speed)
- **Lightweight**: Phi-3-mini for resource-constrained systems
- **Specialized**: Fine-tuned model for system commands
- **Embedding**: All-MiniLM for semantic similarity

#### Interface Layer
- **Overlay UI**: Minimal, transparent command interface
- **Status Integration**: Show AI status in system bar
- **History Panel**: Command history with undo/redo
- **Configuration**: YAML-based prompt templates

## 🛠️ Example Use Cases

### Developer Workflows
```
"Start my React development environment for the ecommerce project"
→ Opens VSCode, starts dev server, opens browser tabs, connects to database

"I need to debug the authentication issue"
→ Opens relevant log files, starts debugger, highlights recent auth-related code changes

"Prepare for the client demo"
→ Closes unnecessary windows, opens presentation mode, starts recording software
```

### System Administration
```
"The system feels slow, investigate"
→ Runs performance diagnostics, identifies bottlenecks, suggests optimizations

"Backup my current project state"
→ Commits code, creates system snapshot, uploads to cloud storage

"Set up a distraction-free writing environment"
→ Enables focus mode, blocks social media, opens preferred text editor
```

## 🎯 Competitive Landscape

### Current Solutions
- **Claude Code**: External tool, requires internet
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: Limited to git operations
- **Siri/Cortana**: Cloud-dependent, basic system control

### Our Advantages
- **Privacy**: Completely local processing
- **Speed**: No network latency
- **Context**: Deep system integration
- **Extensibility**: Open-source, hackable
- **Performance**: Native C++ implementation

## 🚧 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Model Size vs Performance
- **Problem**: Large models need significant RAM/VRAM
- **Solution**: Model quantization, smart loading/unloading
- **Implementation**: Load model parts on-demand, use CPU inference for simple commands

### Challenge 2: Real-time Responsiveness
- **Problem**: AI inference can block compositor
- **Solution**: Asynchronous processing, command queuing
- **Implementation**: Separate AI thread with lock-free communication

### Challenge 3: Context Management
- **Problem**: Maintaining system state awareness
- **Solution**: Efficient state serialization, incremental updates
- **Implementation**: JSON-based context store with diff tracking

### Challenge 4: Security & Sandboxing
- **Problem**: AI executing system commands poses risks
- **Solution**: Permission system, command validation
- **Implementation**: Whitelist approach with user confirmation for dangerous operations

## 📊 Success Metrics & Validation
